# End-to-end Deep Learning Interface

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end deep learning interface designed to facilitate the creation, training, and deployment of deep learning models. The interface leverages various powerful libraries and frameworks to streamline the process, making it accessible even to those with minimal coding experience.

## Features

- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with PyQt6 to ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing**: Utilizes Albumentations and OpenCV for robust data augmentation and preprocessing steps.
- **Model Building**: Employs PyTorch for constructing and training neural networks.

## Dependencies

To set up the virtual environment and activate it, use the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv your_virtual_env_name

# On Windows
your_virtual_env_name\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source your_virtual_env_name/bin/activate
```

To install the required libraries and frameworks, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

## Use Case

This interface is designed for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI enthusiasts who wish to build and deploy deep learning models efficiently. It is particularly useful for those who want to focus on model development without getting bogged down by the intricacies of code implementation. This tool can be used for a variety of applications, including but not limited to:

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Semantic Segmentation
- Instance Segmentation

## Future Work

The project aims to continuously evolve by incorporating new features and improvements. Some of the planned updates include:

- Support for Other Frameworks: Adding compatibility with TensorFlow.
